## 🚀 About Me

I'm an **AI Product Developer & Prompt Engineer** who builds real products through:

- AI-assisted development  
- Modular prompt systems  
- User testing–driven iteration  
- Zero/low-code prototyping  
- Rapid product workflows  

Instead of writing traditional code, I **use models as a core development engine**—designing systems, reasoning flows, and interaction patterns directly through AI.

## 🔧 What I Do

- 🤖 **AI Agent Design**  
- 🧠 **Prompt Engineering (System, Tools, Modular Architecture)**  
- ⚡ **Vibe Coding (AI-assisted rapid building)**  
- 🧩 **AI-first Product Development**  
- 🧪 **User Test Design & Scenario Mapping**  
- 🗺️ **Product Blueprint Creation**  
- 🛠️ **Zero/Low-Code Prototyping**

## 📚 Featured Work Areas

### 🔥 AI Prompt Library  
Reusable, modular, high-performance prompts for product, engineering, research, and testing flows.

### 🤖 AI Agent Templates  
Plug-and-play agent designs for multi-step reasoning and complex task flows.

### 🎛️ Vibe Coding Projects  
Mini products built purely through reasoning workflows and AI-guided development.

### 🧪 User Testing Lab  
User testing scripts, behavioral scenarios, analysis patterns, and UX evaluation prompts.

### 🗺️ AI Product Blueprint Kits  
Starter kits for building AI-powered products from idea → prototype → iteration.

## 📈 My Approach: AI-First Development

1. **Idea → Prompt-generated product concepts**  
2. **Flows → AI-mapped user journeys**  
3. **Features → Reasoning-based development**  
4. **User tests → Prompt iteration cycles**  
5. **Prototype → Fast delivery through AI**

I use AI not just to assist but to **drive the product development process**.
